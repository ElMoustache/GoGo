To generate a new protocol set, run the correct .protocol file as a parameter
to parse.py. Sample usage for ijji.protocol is...

./parse.py ijji.protocol

This will generate the necessary files in the subdirectores of whatever
directory parse.py resides in. After they're generated, feel free to add them
to the project and add the two generated cpp files to the build. DO NOT COMMIT
THE GENERATED FILES UNLESS THEY'VE BEEN MERGED INTO THE REST OF THE PROJECT.
That's a lot of wasted space.

Oh yeah, and sorry for the mess in parse.py - I just wanted to get it done =/
